This project is a simple countdown timer written in Python. The program allows the user to enter a time in seconds, counts down to zero, and plays a sound when the time is up.

How to use:
Run the main.py script in a Python environment.
When prompted, enter the time in seconds.
The program will display the countdown in hh:mm:ss format.
When the countdown ends, a beep sound is played and the message "Time's up!" is printed.

Technologies:
Python 3.x
time module for delaying execution
winsound module for sound playback (Windows platform)
