This repo serves as my Python portfolio and contains beginner and advanced projects I did. It's main purpose is to help me improve Python skills and to show projects to date.

It has various level projects, starting from easier.
Some are simple and basics training, some are scripts for automating tasks, some are data-oriented, meaning to process data and to work with csv and json files, and outer API's projects.

Each project file consists of:
main.py – main Python script
README.md – User manual and description
requirements.txt – if project uses some packages
